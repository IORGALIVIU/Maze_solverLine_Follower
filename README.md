# Maze_solverLine_Follower
# Line Follower – 3rd Place Winner @ Continental Hackathon 2025

This repository contains the source code for a high-performance **line follower robot** developed for the **Continental Hackathon 2025**, where it proudly earned **3rd place** among competitive entries focused on robotics, automation, and embedded systems.

## 🏁 Project Overview

The robot is designed to follow a black line on a track with precision and speed. Using reflectance sensors and a simple yet efficient control algorithm, it can handle sharp turns, straight lines, and adapt to different lighting conditions through sensor calibration.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time line detection using TRSensors or similar reflectance sensors  
- Proportional (P) control algorithm for steering adjustment  
- Automatic sensor calibration at startup  
- Speed optimization based on track curvature  
- Clean, modular code for easy modification and tuning

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language**: C
- **Hardware Platform**: AlphaBot 2   
- **Sensors**: Infrared reflectance array  
- **Motor Control**: PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)  
- **Development Environment**: Arduino IDE 

## 🏆 Achievements

- 🥉 Placed **3rd** at the **Continental Hackathon 2025**, a competition that challenged participants to build autonomous robots capable of fast, accurate line following.
